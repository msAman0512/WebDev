** INTRO TO HTML

* Every HTML document corresponds to a single page.HTML is not a case sensitive language.
* The 'tag' - contains a '<' ,'>' and a tag name.
* <B> - this tag makes text bold.
* Start and end tags differ by a '/'- e.g. <B> is start tag and </B> or <B\>is the end tag.
* Text to be formatted are enclosed between the start and end tags.
* The tag that also has an end tag and can contain some parameter between the start and end tags - Container element
* The tag that do not have an end tag - Empty element. e.g. <BR> and <HR> tags.
* Format of basic HTML document is:
